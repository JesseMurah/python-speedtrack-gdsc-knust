Now create a branch using the `git switch` command:
:   

    git switch -c your-new-branch-name
For example:
:   

    git switch -c my-learn-python
    
### 4. Make necessary changes and commit those changes
Now open it in any IDE of your choice, e.g.`VSCode` and add projects you have done under the sub-topics in python in any of the days and save the file/folder.

When you are done, execute the command `git status` on your command line, you'll see there are changes.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:
:   

    git add .

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:
:   

    git commit -m "Any meaningful commit message"
    
# 5. Push changes to GitHub
Push your changes using the command `git push`:
:   

    git push -u origin your-branch-name
replacing `your-branch-name` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

## Submit your changes for review
If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull` request button. Click on that button.

Now submit the pull request.
Soon I'll be merging all your changes into the main branch of this project. You will get a notification email once the changes have been merged.
